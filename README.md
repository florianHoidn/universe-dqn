This repository accompanies my blog titled ["Off-Policy Q-learning in OpenAIÂ Universe"](https://medium.com/@hoidnflo/off-policy-q-learning-in-openai-universe-part-1-setting-up-openais-baseline-dqn-6ae00f08a049) that can be found on Medium. I experiment with OpenAI Baseline's DQN and show how to use it in an OpenAI Universe environment.
